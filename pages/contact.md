## Club members

To communicate with the club members, follow [Gainesville Pickleball Players](https://www.facebook.com/groups/447983062635841/) on Facebook. It's a great place to hear about pickup games, social events, who's playing where, and weather-related court status. It's a private group, so you'll need a Facebook account to request access.


## Leadership

If you have questions about the club, please feel free to email the [club leadership](mailto:john@pickleballgainesville.com?Subject=Pickleball%20question).
